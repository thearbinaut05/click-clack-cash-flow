## Example Revenue Calculation

### Scenario 1: Survey Offers
```
100 users √ó 3 surveys/month √ó $0.75 payout √ó 20% conversion
= 100 √ó 3 √ó 0.75 √ó 0.20
= $45/month
```

### Scenario 2: Mixed Offers
```
1000 users √ó average scenario:
- 2 surveys at $0.75 (20% conversion)
- 1 app install at $1.50 (10% conversion)
- 3 email signups at $0.50 (30% conversion)

Revenue per user = (2 √ó 0.75 √ó 0.20) + (1 √ó 1.50 √ó 0.10) + (3 √ó 0.50 √ó 0.30)
                 = 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.45
                 = $0.90/user/month

1000 users = $900/month
```
