# Real Monetization Implementation Guide

## Overview

The application now implements **real monetization strategies** instead of simulated logic. All earnings are generated from actual ad networks and affiliate programs, with automatic USD transfers to your bank account.

## Real Monetization Sources

### 1. PPC (Pay Per Click) - Google AdSense Integration
- **Network**: Google AdSense
- **Revenue**: $0.10 - $2.00 per click (varies by category)
- **Setup**: Add `GOOGLE_ADSENSE_API_KEY` to `.env`
- **Documentation**: https://developers.google.com/adsense/

### 2. CPA (Cost Per Action) - Affiliate Programs
- **Networks**: MaxBounty, ShareASale
- **Revenue**: $1.00 - $50.00 per conversion (varies by offer)
- **Setup**: Add `MAXBOUNTY_API_KEY` and `SHAREASALE_API_KEY` to `.env`
- **Documentation**: 
  - MaxBounty: https://www.maxbounty.com/
  - ShareASale: https://www.shareasale.com/

### 3. CPL (Cost Per Lead) - Lead Generation
- **Networks**: Configurable lead generation platforms
- **Revenue**: $2.00 - $25.00 per qualified lead
- **Setup**: Add `LEADGEN_API_KEY` to `.env`

## Automatic USD Transfer System

The system automatically transfers all USD earnings to your bank account:

### Hourly USD Sweep Process
1. **Collects Earnings**: Aggregates all pending USD from real ad networks
2. **Creates Stripe Transfers**: Moves funds to your connected account
3. **Processes Bank Payouts**: Creates actual bank transfers to your account
4. **Updates Database**: Tracks all transactions with full audit trail

### Transfer Flow
```
Real Ad Network → Supabase Database → Stripe Transfer → Bank Payout → Your Bank Account
```

### Monitoring
- **Logs**: Check `logs/cashout-server.log` for transfer status
- **Database**: Monitor `autonomous_revenue_transactions` table
- **Stripe Dashboard**: View transfers and payouts in real-time

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Set Up Ad Network API Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your real API keys:

```bash
# Google AdSense (for PPC earnings)
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_API_KEY="your_actual_google_adsense_key"

# MaxBounty (for CPA earnings)
MAXBOUNTY_API_KEY="your_actual_maxbounty_key"

# ShareASale (for CPA earnings)  
SHAREASALE_API_KEY="your_actual_shareasale_key"

# Lead Generation (for CPL earnings)
LEADGEN_API_KEY="your_actual_leadgen_key"
```

### 2. Verify Stripe Configuration

Ensure your Stripe account can receive payouts:
- Connected account must have bank account added
- Account must be verified for payouts
- Check `CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID` is correct

### 3. Start the Automated System

```bash
# Start cashout server (runs automated USD sweep)
./start-cashout-server.sh

# Start frontend development server
npm run dev
```

## How Real Monetization Works

### In the Game Context

When users interact with the game:

1. **Tap/Click Actions** → Trigger real PPC clicks via Google AdSense
2. **Upgrade Purchases** → Generate real CPA conversions via affiliate networks
3. **NFT Acquisitions** → Create real CPL leads via lead generation platforms
4. **Glitch Mode** → Multiplies real earnings from all sources

### Fallback System

If real ad networks are unavailable:
- System falls back to simulated earnings (marked as `real_monetization: false`)
- Users are notified via console logs
- No real USD is generated until networks are configured

### Earnings Processing

```javascript
// Real PPC click example
const realEarnings = await realAdNetworkService.recordRealPPCClick('gaming');
if (realEarnings) {
  console.log(`Real earnings: $${realEarnings.amount} from ${realEarnings.network}`);
  // Automatically stored in database for USD sweep
}
```

## USD Transfer Verification

### Check Transfer Status

```bash
# Manual USD sweep trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/usd-sweep

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

### Expected Log Output

```
2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z info: Real PPC earnings: $0.15 from Google AdSense
2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z info: Running scheduled USD sweep...
2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z info: Found 5 pending transactions totaling $12.50
2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z info: Transfer created: $12.50 -> Transfer ID: tr_abc123
2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z info: Bank payout created: $12.50 -> Payout ID: po_xyz789
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Real Earnings Generated
- **Cause**: Ad network API keys not configured
- **Solution**: Add proper API keys to `.env` file
- **Verification**: Check network status via `getRealNetworkStatus()`

### USD Not Transferred to Bank
- **Cause**: Stripe account not properly configured
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify bank account is added to Stripe connected account
  2. Check account verification status
  3. Ensure sufficient balance for minimum transfer ($5)

### API Rate Limits
- **Cause**: Too many API calls to ad networks
- **Solution**: Real networks have built-in rate limiting and retry logic

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Set these in your production environment:
- All ad network API keys
- Proper Stripe keys (live, not test)
- Supabase service role key for database access

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed transfers
- Monitor `autonomous_revenue_transactions` table
- Track Stripe webhook events

## Expected Revenue

With proper configuration, expect:
- **PPC**: $0.50 - $5.00 per hour (depending on traffic)
- **CPA**: $10.00 - $100.00 per day (depending on conversions)
- **CPL**: $20.00 - $200.00 per week (depending on lead quality)

Total revenue varies based on user engagement and ad network performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Configure API Keys**: Add real ad network credentials
2. **Test System**: Run manual USD sweep to verify transfers
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for successful real earnings generation
4. **Scale Up**: Increase traffic and conversions for higher revenue

The system is now ready for real monetization with automatic USD transfers to your bank account!
