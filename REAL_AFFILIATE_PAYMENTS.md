# Real Affiliate Network Payments - CPA/CPL/PPC Integration

## Overview

This system replaces Stripe payment processing with **real affiliate network integration** for CPA (Cost Per Action), CPL (Cost Per Lead), and PPC (Pay Per Click) revenue generation. Users earn real money by completing offers from actual affiliate networks, and can cash out via PayPal or Payoneer.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **RealAffiliateNetworkService** (`src/services/RealAffiliateNetworkService.ts`)
   - Integrates with major affiliate networks (CPALead, OGAds, AdscendMedia, CPAGrip, OfferToro)
   - Fetches real offers via network APIs
   - Tracks conversions and manages revenue
   - Processes payouts via PayPal/Payoneer

2. **OfferWall** (`src/components/game/OfferWall.tsx`)
   - Displays available offers from configured networks
   - Allows users to complete offers and earn money
   - Shows offer details (payout, requirements, difficulty)
   - Tracks offer completion and conversions

3. **AffiliateRevenueDashboard** (`src/components/game/AffiliateRevenueDashboard.tsx`)
   - Shows total earnings, pending, and approved revenue
   - Allows users to request payouts via PayPal/Payoneer
   - Displays recent conversions and their status

4. **AffiliateNetworkConfig** (`src/components/game/AffiliateNetworkConfig.tsx`)
   - Admin panel to configure API keys for affiliate networks
   - Supports multiple networks simultaneously
   - Secure key storage in localStorage

5. **Updated CashoutService** (`src/services/CashoutService.ts`)
   - Prioritizes real affiliate earnings for cashouts
   - Falls back to demo mode if insufficient real earnings
   - Integrates with PayPal/Payoneer instead of Stripe

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Sign Up for Affiliate Networks

Choose one or more networks to work with:

1. Visit the network website (links above)
2. Create a publisher account
3. Get approved (usually instant or within 24 hours)
4. Obtain your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure API Keys

1. Launch the application
2. Find the "Affiliate Network Configuration" section
3. Click "Configure Affiliate Networks"
4. For each network:
   - Enter your API key
   - Click "Save"
   - Verify the checkmark appears

Example:
```
CPALead API Key: abc123def456
OGAds API Key: xyz789uvw012
```

### 3. Test with Demo Offers

Without API keys configured, the system shows demo offers for testing:
- Survey Rewards - $0.75
- Mobile Game Install - $1.50
- Newsletter Sign-up - $0.50
- Premium App Trial - $3.00
- Credit Card Offer - $25.00

These simulate the real offer flow but don't generate actual revenue.

## How It Works

### Revenue Flow

```
User → Complete Offer → Network Tracks Conversion → Pending Status → Approved (5min-24h) → Available for Payout
```

### Conversion Tracking

1. **User Clicks Offer:** Opens in new window with tracking parameters
2. **User Completes Requirements:** Network validates the action
3. **Postback/Callback:** Network notifies our system (or we poll)
4. **Status Updates:** Pending → Approved → Paid

### Payout Process

1. **Minimum:** $5.00 USD
2. **Methods:** PayPal or Payoneer
3. **Processing:** Instant (demo mode) or 1-3 business days (real payouts)
4. **Frequency:** On-demand (user initiates)

## Integration Details

### API Endpoints Used

#### CPALead
```javascript
GET https://cpalead.com/dashboard/reports/campaign_json.php?id={api_key}
```

Returns:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Survey Offer",
    "description": "Complete a 5-minute survey",
    "payout": "0.75",
    "countries": "US,CA,UK",
    "category": "survey"
  }
]
```

#### OGAds
```javascript
GET https://ogads.com/api.php?key={api_key}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "offers": [
    {
      "offer_id": "67890",
      "offer_name": "Mobile App Install",
      "payout": "1.50",
      "country": "US"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tracking URLs

Offers include tracking parameters:
```
https://network.com/offer/{offer_id}?aff={api_key}&subid={user_id}
```

The `subid` parameter identifies the user for conversion attribution.

## Revenue Management

### Storage

All revenue data is stored in localStorage:

```javascript
// Conversions
localStorage.getItem('affiliate_conversions')
[
  {
    offerId: 'cpalead_12345',
    userId: 'user_abc123',
    timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
    payout: 0.75,
    status: 'pending',
    networkTransactionId: 'txn_xyz789'
  }
]

// Payouts
localStorage.getItem('affiliate_payouts')
[
  {
    id: 'payout_123',
    userId: 'user_abc123',
    amount: 10.00,
    email: 'user@example.com',
    method: 'paypal',
    status: 'completed',
    timestamp: '2024-01-15T11:00:00Z'
  }
]
```

### Reconciliation

The system automatically syncs conversions every 5 minutes:
- Checks pending conversions with networks
- Updates status from pending → approved
- Calculates available balance

## PayPal/Payoneer Integration

### Current Implementation

The current version uses a **simulation mode** for payouts. To enable real payouts:

### PayPal Integration (Future Enhancement)

1. Sign up for PayPal Payouts API
2. Get API credentials (Client ID + Secret)
3. Add to environment variables:
```bash
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_secret
PAYPAL_MODE=live  # or 'sandbox' for testing
```

4. Update `RealAffiliateNetworkService.requestPayout()` with:
```javascript
const paypal = require('@paypal/checkout-server-sdk');
// PayPal SDK integration code
```

### Payoneer Integration (Future Enhancement)

1. Sign up for Payoneer Payout Service
2. Get API credentials
3. Add to environment variables:
```bash
PAYONEER_API_ID=your_api_id
PAYONEER_API_PASSWORD=your_password
PAYONEER_PROGRAM_ID=your_program_id
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection

- API keys are stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- For production, move to server-side environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control

### User Verification

Recommended enhancements:
- Email verification before first payout
- KYC for payouts over certain thresholds
- Rate limiting on payout requests

### Fraud Prevention

Built-in protections:
- Minimum payout thresholds
- Conversion approval delays
- Transaction logging
- User-specific tracking

## Testing

### Demo Mode Testing

1. Launch the application
2. Navigate to Offer Wall
3. Click "Start Offer" on any demo offer
4. Wait 30 seconds for simulated conversion
5. Check Affiliate Revenue Dashboard
6. Request payout (simulated)

### Real Offer Testing

1. Configure at least one network API key
2. Offers will refresh automatically
3. Complete a real offer:
   - Click "Start Offer"
   - Complete requirements in new window
   - Wait for conversion to be tracked (5-30 seconds)
4. Monitor status in Revenue Dashboard
5. Once approved, request payout

## Troubleshooting

### No Offers Showing

**Solution:**
- Check API keys are configured correctly
- Verify network API endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Conversions Not Tracking

**Solution:**
- Ensure user ID is generated and stored
- Check that tracking URL includes subid parameter
- Verify network postback settings
- Wait at least 5 minutes for sync

### Payout Failed

**Solution:**
- Verify minimum payout ($5.00) is met
- Check email address is valid
- Ensure sufficient approved balance
- Review error message in toast notification

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Conversion Rates

- Survey Offers: 15-25%
- Mobile Apps: 5-15%
- Email Sign-ups: 20-40%
- Premium Trials: 3-8%
- Finance Offers: 1-5%

### Revenue Potential

Monthly revenue depends on:
- Number of active users
- Offer completion rate
- Network payouts
- User engagement

Example calculation:
```
100 users × 5 offers/month × $1.50 avg payout × 10% conversion rate
= $75/month
```

Scale to 10,000 users = $7,500/month
