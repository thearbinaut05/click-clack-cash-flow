## Module 1: Revenue Recognition Fundamentals (90 minutes)

### 1.1 The Five-Step Revenue Recognition Model

#### Step 1: Identify the Contract
**Key Concept**: A contract is an agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations.

**In Our System**:
- Revenue streams table contains all contracts
- Status must be 'active' for revenue recognition
- Contract terms stored in JSON configuration

**Interactive Exercise 1.1**:
```
Scenario: A customer signs up for our monthly SaaS service at $99/month with a 12-month commitment.

Question: Is this a valid contract for revenue recognition purposes?
A) Yes, it meets all criteria
B) No, needs additional documentation  
C) Depends on payment terms
D) Only if prepaid

Answer: A) Yes, it meets all criteria
Explanation: The agreement has commercial substance, is approved by both parties, identifies rights and obligations, has defined payment terms, and it's probable we'll collect the consideration.
```

#### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
**Key Concept**: Promises to transfer distinct goods or services.

**Our Performance Obligations**:
- Software service provision
- Data processing services
- API access
- Support services

**Interactive Exercise 1.2**:
```
Scenario: Our contract includes:
- Monthly software access ($80)
- Setup service ($200) 
- Priority support ($20/month)

Question: How many performance obligations are there?
A) 1 - Bundle everything together
B) 2 - Software+support, Setup separate
C) 3 - All are distinct
D) Depends on customer usage

Answer: C) 3 - All are distinct
Explanation: Each service is distinct and separately identifiable, providing independent value to the customer.
```

### 1.2 Revenue Recognition Timing

#### Point-in-Time vs. Over-Time Recognition

**Point-in-Time Examples**:
- Software delivery/activation
- One-time setup services
- Performance milestones

**Over-Time Examples**:
- Monthly SaaS subscriptions
- Ongoing support services
- Continuous monitoring

**Interactive Simulation 1.2**:
```javascript
// Revenue Recognition Simulator
function simulateRevenueRecognition(contractType, amount, period) {
  if (contractType === 'subscription') {
    return recognizeOverTime(amount, period);
  } else if (contractType === 'setup') {
    return recognizePointInTime(amount);
  }
}

// Try it: Enter a $1,200 annual subscription
// Expected: $100/month recognition over 12 months
```

### Quiz 1: Revenue Recognition Basics
```
1. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when:
   A) Cash is received
   B) Contract is signed
   C) Performance obligations are satisfied
   D) Invoice is sent

2. A $600 annual subscription should be recognized as:
   A) $600 immediately
   B) $50 per month
   C) $150 per quarter
   D) When customer pays

3. If a performance milestone is 80% complete:
   A) Recognize 80% of revenue
   B) Recognize 100% of revenue
   C) Recognize no revenue yet
   D) Depends on contract terms

Answers: 1-C, 2-B, 3-D
```

## Module 2: System Operations and Implementation (90 minutes)

### 2.1 Database Schema Navigation

#### Core Tables Overview
```sql
-- Key tables for revenue recognition
revenue_streams              -- Contract definitions
revenue_recognition_events   -- Recognition transactions
autonomous_revenue_transactions -- Transaction records
financial_statements        -- Compiled financial data
application_balance         -- Current balance tracking
```

#### Hands-On Exercise 2.1: Query Revenue Data
```sql
-- Exercise: Find all revenue recognized this month
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  recognized_amount,
  recognition_method,
  recognition_date
FROM revenue_recognition_events 
WHERE MONTH(recognition_date) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY recognition_date DESC;

-- Expected output: List of current month revenue events
```

### 2.2 Automated Recognition Processes

#### System Workflow
1. **Transaction Creation**: Automatic when customer pays
2. **Performance Assessment**: System checks completion status
3. **Recognition Trigger**: Automated when obligations satisfied
4. **Financial Statement Update**: Real-time updates to financials

#### Interactive Demo 2.2: Transaction Processing
```javascript
// Simulate processing a new subscription
const processSubscription = async (customerData) => {
  // Step 1: Create revenue stream
  const stream = await createRevenueStream({
    customer_id: customerData.id,
    amount: customerData.monthly_amount,
    type: 'subscription',
    recognition_method: 'over_time'
  });
  
  // Step 2: Set up recognition schedule
  await createRecognitionSchedule(stream.id);
  
  // Step 3: Begin monthly recognition
  await scheduleMonthlyRecognition(stream.id);
};

// Try it with sample data:
// Customer: "ACME Corp", Amount: $199/month
```

### 2.3 Manual Override Procedures

#### When Manual Intervention is Required
1. **Complex Contract Modifications**: Changes to existing agreements
2. **Dispute Resolution**: Customer billing disputes
3. **Non-Standard Pricing**: Custom pricing arrangements
4. **System Errors**: Correction of automated mistakes

#### Override Process Simulation
```
Scenario: Customer disputes $500 charge, we agree to $400 credit.

Steps:
1. Document dispute details
2. Get management approval (>$100 requires supervisor)
3. Create manual adjustment entry
4. Update recognition records
5. Generate audit trail

Practice: Complete the override form for this scenario
[Interactive form would appear here]
```

### Quiz 2: System Operations
```
1. To find all revenue for a specific customer, query:
   A) revenue_streams table only
   B) revenue_recognition_events table only  
   C) Both tables joined by customer_id
   D) financial_statements table

2. Manual overrides require:
   A) System administrator approval
   B) Management approval based on amount
   C) Customer confirmation
   D) External auditor approval

3. Automated recognition triggers when:
   A) Customer pays invoice
   B) Performance obligations are satisfied
   C) Month-end processing runs
   D) Manager approves transaction

Answers: 1-C, 2-B, 3-B
```

## Module 3: Expense Recognition and Matching (60 minutes)

### 3.1 The Matching Principle

#### Core Concept
Match expenses with the revenues they help generate in the same accounting period.

#### Our Implementation
```sql
-- Example: AI agent costs matched with generated revenue
SELECT 
  a.id as agent_id,
  a.revenue_generated,
  a.total_cost,
  (a.revenue_generated - a.total_cost) as net_profit,
  ((a.revenue_generated - a.total_cost) / a.total_cost) * 100 as roi_percentage
FROM agent_swarms a
WHERE a.status = 'active';
```

### 3.2 Cost Classification

#### Direct vs. Indirect Costs
**Direct Costs** (traceable to specific revenue):
- AI agent operational costs
- Transaction processing fees
- Specific infrastructure usage

**Indirect Costs** (shared across revenue streams):
- General infrastructure
- Administrative expenses
- Shared services

#### Cost Allocation Exercise
```
Scenario: $1,000 server cost supports 3 agents generating:
- Agent A: $500 revenue
- Agent B: $300 revenue  
- Agent C: $200 revenue

Calculate allocation:
Total revenue: $1,000
Agent A allocation: $1,000 × ($500/$1,000) = $500
Agent B allocation: $1,000 × ($300/$1,000) = $300
Agent C allocation: $1,000 × ($200/$1,000) = $200

Practice: Calculate for different revenue scenarios
```

### 3.3 Automated Cost Tracking

#### Real-Time Cost Updates
```javascript
// Automated hourly cost update
const updateAgentCosts = async () => {
  const activeAgents = await getActiveAgents();
  
  for (const agent of activeAgents) {
    const hourlyCost = calculateVMCost(agent.vm_type);
    await updateAgentCost(agent.id, hourlyCost);
  }
};

// Simulation: Track costs for 24-hour period
// Input: Agent with $0.50/hour cost
// Expected: $12.00 daily cost accumulation
```

### Quiz 3: Expense Recognition
```
1. Under the matching principle, when should we recognize AI agent costs?
   A) When the agent is deployed
   B) When we pay the hosting bill
   C) In the same period as related revenue
   D) At month-end only

2. A $1,200 shared server cost should be allocated based on:
   A) Equal splits among all agents
   B) Revenue proportion of each agent
   C) Time each agent was active
   D) Manager discretion

3. Direct costs are:
   A) Always more important than indirect costs
   B) Traceable to specific revenue sources
   C) Only infrastructure-related costs
   D) Costs paid directly by customers

Answers: 1-C, 2-B, 3-B
```

FROM revenue_recognition_events 
WHERE recognition_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(recognition_date)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Run this query and interpret results
```

### 4.2 Profitability Analysis

#### Key Metrics Dashboard
```javascript
// KPI calculation simulation
const calculateKPIs = (revenue, expenses) => ({
  grossMargin: ((revenue - expenses) / revenue) * 100,
  netProfit: revenue - expenses,
  costRatio: (expenses / revenue) * 100,
  roi: ((revenue - expenses) / expenses) * 100
