## Policy Overview

### Purpose
This manual provides comprehensive guidance for implementing updated revenue recognition policies within the company to ensure accurate and timely recording of revenue, prevent revenue leakage, and maximize revenue potential while maintaining compliance with ASC 606 (GAAP) and IFRS 15.

### Scope
This policy applies to all revenue-generating activities including:
- Autonomous revenue transactions
- Software as a Service (SaaS) revenue
- Performance-based revenue
- Subscription revenue
- Transaction-based revenue

### Objectives
1. **Accuracy**: Ensure revenue is recorded accurately and in the correct period
2. **Timeliness**: Recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied
3. **Compliance**: Maintain adherence to accounting standards
4. **Prevention**: Eliminate revenue leakage through proper controls
5. **Optimization**: Maximize revenue potential through proper timing

## Revenue Recognition Principles

### The Five-Step Model (ASC 606 / IFRS 15)

#### Step 1: Identify the Contract with a Customer
**Definition**: A contract exists when there is a commercial arrangement with enforceable rights and obligations.

**Implementation in Our System**:
- Contracts are automatically identified through the `revenue_streams` table
- Each revenue stream represents a contractual arrangement
- Status tracking ensures only valid contracts generate revenue

**Database Implementation**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM revenue_streams 
WHERE status = 'active' 
AND config ->> 'contract_terms' IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations
**Definition**: Performance obligations are promises to transfer distinct goods or services to customers.

**Our Performance Obligations**:
- Software service delivery
- API access provision
- Data processing services
- Autonomous system operation

**Tracking Method**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM revenue_recognition_events 
WHERE recognition_basis = 'performance_obligation_satisfied';
```

#### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price
**Definition**: The transaction price is the amount of consideration expected in exchange for transferring goods or services.

**Our Approach**:
- Fixed pricing for subscription services
- Variable pricing for usage-based services
- Performance bonuses for autonomous systems

**Calculation Logic**:
```sql
-- Transaction price calculation
SELECT 
  stream_id,
  amount,
  transaction_price_allocated,
  CASE 
    WHEN performance_obligation_satisfied = true 
    THEN amount 
    ELSE 0 
  END as recognizable_revenue
FROM autonomous_revenue_transactions;
```

#### Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price
**Definition**: Allocate transaction price to each performance obligation based on standalone selling prices.

**Allocation Method**:
- Standalone selling price for each service component
- Proportional allocation for bundled services
- Fair value determination for unique services

#### Step 5: Recognize Revenue
**Definition**: Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.

**Recognition Triggers**:
- Service delivery completion
- Time-based recognition for subscriptions
- Usage-based recognition for variable services
- Milestone achievement for performance contracts

## Implementation Procedures

### Automated Revenue Recognition Workflow

#### 1. Contract Setup
```javascript
// Automated contract creation
const createRevenueStream = async (contractData) => {
  return await supabase
    .from('revenue_streams')
    .insert({
      name: contractData.name,
      type: contractData.type,
      status: 'active',
      config: {
        contract_terms: contractData.terms,
        recognition_method: contractData.method,
        performance_obligations: contractData.obligations
      }
    });
};
```

#### 2. Performance Obligation Tracking
```sql
-- Create recognition event when obligation is satisfied
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events (
  transaction_id,
  recognition_basis,
  recognized_amount,
  recognition_method,
  recognition_date
) VALUES (
  transaction_id,
  'performance_obligation_satisfied',
  calculated_amount,
  'point_in_time', -- or 'over_time'
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3. Revenue Recognition Timing

**Point-in-Time Recognition**:
- Software delivery
- One-time services
- Performance milestones

**Over-Time Recognition**:
- Subscription services
- Ongoing service provision
- Continuous value delivery

### Manual Override Procedures

#### When Manual Intervention is Required
1. Complex contract modifications
2. Dispute resolution
3. Non-standard pricing arrangements
4. Refund processing

#### Manual Override Process
1. **Document Justification**: Clear business reason for override
2. **Management Approval**: Required approval levels based on amount
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation in system
4. **Review Process**: Periodic review of all manual overrides

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Subscription Revenue

**Scenario**: Monthly SaaS subscription of $100/month

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Monthly revenue recognition
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events (
  transaction_id,
  recognition_basis,
  recognized_amount,
  recognition_method,
  recognition_date
) VALUES (
  'saas_001',
  'time_based',
  100.00,
  'over_time',
  '2024-01-31'
);
```

**Journal Entry**:
- Debit: Cash $100
- Credit: Revenue $100

### Example 2: Performance-Based Revenue

**Scenario**: $1,000 bonus for achieving 95% uptime

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Performance milestone recognition
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events (
  transaction_id,
  recognition_basis,
  recognized_amount,
  recognition_method,
  recognition_date
) VALUES (
  'perf_001',
  'performance_milestone_achieved',
  1000.00,
  'point_in_time',
  '2024-01-31'
);
```

### Example 3: Usage-Based Revenue

**Scenario**: $0.10 per API call, 1,000 calls in January

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Usage-based recognition
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events (
  transaction_id,
  recognition_basis,
  recognized_amount,
  recognition_method,
  recognition_date
) VALUES (
  'usage_001',
  'usage_consumption',
  100.00, -- 1000 calls Ã— $0.10
  'point_in_time',
  '2024-01-31'
);
```

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Multi-Element Arrangement

**Business Scenario**:
Company provides:
- Software license ($500)
- Implementation services ($300)
- 12 months support ($200)

**Total Contract Value**: $1,000

**Allocation**:
- Software: $500 (standalone selling price)
- Implementation: $300 (standalone selling price)
- Support: $200 (standalone selling price)

**Recognition Pattern**:
- Software: Recognize $500 at delivery
- Implementation: Recognize $300 upon completion
- Support: Recognize $200 over 12 months ($16.67/month)

**Database Implementation**:
```sql
-- Software component
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events VALUES 
('contract_001_software', 'delivery_complete', 500.00, 'point_in_time', '2024-01-15');

-- Implementation component
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events VALUES 
('contract_001_implementation', 'service_complete', 300.00, 'point_in_time', '2024-02-01');

-- Support component (monthly)
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events VALUES 
('contract_001_support_jan', 'time_based', 16.67, 'over_time', '2024-01-31');
```

### Case Study 2: Variable Consideration

**Business Scenario**:
Performance contract with:
- Base fee: $1,000
- Performance bonus: 0-$500 based on results
- Expected bonus: $300 (60% probability)

**Recognition Approach**:
- Recognize base fee when service delivered
- Recognize bonus when performance achieved (constraint approach)

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Base fee recognition
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events VALUES 
('var_001_base', 'service_delivery', 1000.00, 'point_in_time', '2024-01-31');

-- Bonus recognition (when achieved)
INSERT INTO revenue_recognition_events VALUES 
('var_001_bonus', 'performance_achieved', 400.00, 'point_in_time', '2024-02-15');
```

### Case Study 3: Contract Modification

**Business Scenario**:
Original contract: $1,000 for Service A
Modification: Add Service B for additional $500

**Analysis**:
- Modification adds distinct service
- Additional consideration reflects standalone selling price
- Treat as separate contract

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Original contract recognition
UPDATE revenue_schedules 
SET status = 'modified'
WHERE contract_id = 'contract_001';

-- New contract component
INSERT INTO revenue_schedules VALUES (
  'contract_001_mod',
  500.00,
  'service_b_delivery',
  'point_in_time',
  '2024-02-01'
);
```

## Compliance Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring Tasks

#### 1. Revenue Recognition Verification
```javascript
// Daily verification script
const verifyDailyRevenue = async () => {
  const { data: events } = await supabase
    .from('revenue_recognition_events')
    .select('*')
    .gte('recognition_date', 'today');
    
  // Verify all events have proper documentation
  const undocumented = events.filter(e => !e.documentation);
  if (undocumented.length > 0) {
    await alertManagement(undocumented);
  }
};
```

#### 2. Balance Reconciliation
```sql
-- Daily balance verification
SELECT 
  SUM(recognized_amount) as total_recognized,
  (SELECT balance_amount FROM application_balance WHERE id = 1) as reported_balance,
  ABS(SUM(recognized_amount) - (SELECT balance_amount FROM application_balance WHERE id = 1)) as variance
FROM revenue_recognition_events 
WHERE recognition_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);
```
